- to_grid_index ok that it returns VectorX<usize>, or should it return Result<VectorX<usize>> because values might not fit in usize?
- Optimization in `DynamicStorage2D`: Implement `cmp` by doing a bitwise comparison instead of cell-by-cell. This requires that we implement `Bits` for `[u8]`, which might be a bit tricky
- Further generalization between 2D and 3D Morton indices. The implementations are often very similar, with slight changes due to different dimensionality. There are some 'heavy lifters', e.g. the `from_grid_index` functions, but a lot is identical as well. Find out how this could be simplified further
    - Not sure if unifying more actually makes the code simpler though...
