- to_grid_index ok that it returns VectorX<usize>, or should it return Result<VectorX<usize>> because values might not fit in usize?
- Optimization in `DynamicStorage2D`: Implement `cmp` by doing a bitwise comparison instead of cell-by-cell. This requires that we implement `Bits` for `[u8]`, which might be a bit tricky
